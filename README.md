# Purpose and technology

This application was my practice of JQuery and AJAX functionality. I've created few functions to get necessary data 
form API and to animate different parts of the site.

# Description and Implementation

Site is welcoming user with "NASA API CHALLENGE" title and loading one random picture from nasa featured section as 
background. If user doesn't scroll site, after 10 seconds page will scroll down automatically to the gallery 
featuring photos from Mars.

At the beginning 6 photos are loaded. User can borwse them by clicking next/previous arrows on the sides of gallery or by
using buttons generated automatically in the middle-down section (circles which represent loaded images).

When all 6 photos are loaded, "Load more" button appears, which allows user to load next 6 photos. User can load max 18
photos.
